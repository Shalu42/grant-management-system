# Grant Management System for Nonprofits

## Overview
This project aims to simplify the grant-making workflow for foundations and nonprofits, enhancing the effectiveness of the nonprofit community.

## Problem
Large foundations often face the challenge of sending formal emails to numerous nonprofits they support, containing specific details like the nonprofit's name, address, and the current date. Manually creating these emails can be time-consuming and error-prone. Our goal is to develop a full-stack application to automate and manage this workflow efficiently.

## Features
- Create and save nonprofits with their metadata (name, address, email)
- Create and save foundations with their metadata (email)
- Send templated emails to nonprofits with personalized fields
- View a history of emails sent to nonprofits

## Assumptions
- Email serves as a unique identifier for both nonprofits and foundations
- Valid data is assumed for API requests

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Java 17 with Spring Boot
- Frontend: ReactJS with TailwindCSS

## Deployment
The project has been deployed and can be accessed at [Grant Management System](https://ngo-admin.demo.mayankagrawal.co.in/foundations)

## Mock Email Sending
The backend uses a mock email client to simulate sending emails when API requests are made.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the backend using Java 17 and Spring Boot
3. Set up the frontend using ReactJS with TailwindCSS
4. Access the deployed application using the provided link

## Contributing
This project is open to contributions from anyone interested in enhancing the grant-making process for nonprofits. Your contributions can help make a positive impact on the nonprofit community.
